# INFO3111-S2018
Summer 2018 INFO-3111 course code (done in class)

This is the 'in class' example code from Michael Feeney's classes at Fanshawe College INFO-3111 "C++ Graphics" class (Computer Programmer Analyst, CPA2, semester 4). 

This summer, we used GLFW, glad, and glm for the base code. This code should work in Visual Studio 2015 and 2017 under Windows 7 and 10 (and I assume 8?).

efore you comment, PLEASE keep in mind that:

- We started with this: http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html
- ** It was coded, interactively, as part of lecturing (i.e. while trying to explain things) in front of the class, during the 2x3 hour class hours/week.** (So ALL of this represents, at most, 40 hours of work. Total.)
- You can watch it being made here: https://www.twitch.tv/lordmichaelmort
- This code is for educational purposes, and this repo is just Where The Code Is/Was during the summer 2018 term. (putting it here was easiest for the students and I) (so I'm not really interested in 'maintaining this project', as it really isn't a 'project' or whatever, so if I ignore a pull request, it's nothing personal; I just have other things/projects/whatever going on)
- Virtually everything in here is (was) an attempt to explain some programming/game engine concept using the most accessible code possible (i.e. aim was for CLARITY of explaining the concept, not making Something Technically Sexy).
- If you were not in the class that year, it may not make sense.
- This isn't intended to be The Greatest Code Evah. So if you find a bug, feel free to point it out, but: I might listen, but don't really care about your personal opinions about C, C++, or whatever other languge/tool/OS you use or prefer. Game engines are mostly written in C (and C++), so that's what we use. Also: You do you.
